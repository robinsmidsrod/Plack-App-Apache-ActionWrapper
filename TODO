Implement a basic test that uses the three example files from the synopsis.

Basically, the process should be something like this:

1. figure_out_apache_binary()
2. verify_apache_version()
3. get_random_free_port()
4. run_apache_on_port()
5. do_mech_tests_on_port()

Part 1 could probably be solved with File::Which, searching for 'apache' and
'httpd'.

Part 2 is required to understand the calling conventions of the apache
version found, and ensure that the binary can execute FastCGI scripts.

Part 3-4 could most probably be solved by using Test::TCP in some way.

Part 5 can use Test::Mechanize, or possibly some parts of the Plack test
suite.

The Plack test suite has something useful prior art (see Plack::Handler
tests).
